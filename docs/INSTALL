# Installation

Copy the custom kernel tar.gz archive to your Raspberry Pi, and use
the `tar` command to extract the archive. In the example, the archive
we will be using is called `adafruit_pitft_kernel_1.20150207-1.tar.gz`. Replace
the name of the example archive with the name of the pitft kernel
tar.gz archive.

```
$ tar xf adafruit_pitft_kernel_1.20150207-1.tar.gz
```

You can now `cd` into the extracted folder. The extracted
folder will have the same name as the archive, minus the
.tar.gz suffix.

```
$ cd adafruit_pitft_kernel_1.20150207-1
```

Now you are ready to run the install script. **Warning!** *Installing
a broken kernel can render your Raspberry Pi unusable. Please backup
your SD card before continuing.*

```
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

If you see an error message, the kernel install failed. If everything goes
well, you will see this message: **Kernel install complete!**. You will
need to reboot for the changes to take effect.

```
$ sudo reboot
```

If you have any problems with the process, please file an issue on GitHub:
